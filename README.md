NS Power BI Reporting Project Goal
Create a PBI Desktop file for Type One Diabetics (T1Ds), who are creating their own DIY artificial pancreases.  The artificial pancreases are created on their cell phones utilizing apps like Loop, OpenAps, AndroidAPS, and Spike which then upload the app's data to a user-specific Nightscout Heroku app & URL.  This Nightscout (NS) Heroku app is sitting on top of a mLab MongoDB. 

We need to utilize PBI Desktop due to the  NS users not being business individuals with PBI licenses and frequently not being technical individuals.  To learn more about NS and the T1D close-loop apps, please check out the following sites:
